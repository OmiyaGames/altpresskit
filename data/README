Put your data.xml, images/videos and game specific subfolders in this folder.
A good template to start from is provided by the original presskit() project: 
https://github.com/ramiismail/dopresskit/blob/master/archive/_data.xml

The data file for my presskit is available at:
https://presskit.grapefrukt.com/data/data.xml

If you wish to look at the data for a game (which goes in a subfolder to this directory), I suggest this one:
https://presskit.grapefrukt.com/data/holedown/data.xml
